#### _Answering Biological Questions Using Circular Data and Analysis in R_
This is a lesson on circular data that Dr. Kate Thomas and I developed and taught to the Biological Data Analysis Course (Bio 304) at Duke University in 2018.

#### "_What are the odds that someone you know will die from COVID-19?_"
This is a shiny app I built in March 2020 to showcase my cousin's [spreadsheet calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19o7CnjXaSMWzbz-FuqmczUNu44fFkVm0TLzSSzJM6pk/edit?fbclid=IwAR2Q6JaYiO0e9cNZnCdqSVBIfvJV_4-Oe5H5yeMEuqkkXjVTUThJfOlwOWI#gid=0), which he wrote at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to encourage people to take social distancing and other precautions seriously.
