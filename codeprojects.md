#### "_COVID-19 Calculator_"
This is a shiny app I built in March 2020 to showcase my cousin's [spreadsheet calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19o7CnjXaSMWzbz-FuqmczUNu44fFkVm0TLzSSzJM6pk/edit?fbclid=IwAR2Q6JaYiO0e9cNZnCdqSVBIfvJV_4-Oe5H5yeMEuqkkXjVTUThJfOlwOWI#gid=0), which he wrote at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to encourage people to take social distancing and other precautions seriously.
