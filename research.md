My current work incorporates approaches from the fields of animal behavior, comparative morphology, and phylogenetics.

#### Current Projects

1. Differences in sea urchin visually-guided behavior, by habitat
2. Trends in spine density & visual acuity across sea urchin species
3. Light sensitivity across the urchin body
4. Learning in brittle stars
