My current work incorporates approaches from the fields of animal behavior, comparative morphology, and phylogenetics to approach questions in sensory biology.

#### Current Projects

1. Differences in sea urchin visually-guided behavior, by habitat
2. Trends in spine density & visual acuity across sea urchin species
3. Light sensitivity across the urchin body
4. Learning in brittle stars
5. Echinoder-Bot-a: A sea urchin-inspired camera
