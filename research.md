My research focuses on the function and behavior of animals with distributed visual and nervous systems. I want to understand what they can sense and what decisions they make with this information. While I primarily work with sea urchins, I am also interested in other echinoderms and marine invertebrates more broadly. My work incorporates behavioral experiments, comparative morphology, and gene expression analysis.

#### Current Projects

1. Sea urchin visually-guided behavior by habitat
2. Trends in spine density & visual acuity across sea urchin species
3. Light sensitivity across the urchin body
4. Learning in brittle stars
