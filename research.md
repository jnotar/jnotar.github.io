My current work incorporates approaches from the fields of animal learning and behavior, comparative morphology, gene expression, and engineering to approach questions in sensory biology.

#### Current Projects

1. Trends in spine density & visual acuity across sea urchin species
2. Light sensitivity across the urchin body
3. Learning in brittle stars
4. Echinoder-Bot-a: A sea urchin-inspired camera
