My research focuses on the function and behavior of animals with distributed/diffuse visual systems. I want to understand what they can see and what decisions they make with the information they can gather from the environment. I have been looking specifically at sea urchins and their visually-guided behavior in a comparative context.

1) Sea Urchin visually-guided behavior by habitat

2) Trends in spine density & visual acuity across sea urchin species

3) Light sensitivity across the urchin body

4) Learning in brittle stars
