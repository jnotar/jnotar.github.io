My research focuses on the function and behavior of animals with distributed/diffuse visual and nervous systems. I want to understand what they can sense and what decisions they make with this information. I have been looking specifically at sea urchins and their visually-guided behavior in a comparative context. My work incorporates behavioral experiments, comparative morphology, and gene expression analysis.

#### Current Projects

1. Sea Urchin visually-guided behavior by habitat
2. Trends in spine density & visual acuity across sea urchin species
3. Light sensitivity across the urchin body
4. Learning in brittle stars
