#### Abstract

We tested whether individuals of the ophiuroid species _Ophiocoma echinata_ were able to associate a period of darkness with the presentation of a food reward. Like other echinoderms, ophiuroids are marine invertebrates that lack centralized nervous systems and instead have five radially arranged ganglia joined by a central nerve ring. Though a small number of studies have demonstrated operant and classical conditioning in sea stars (Class Asteroidea), the other echinoderm classes remain relatively untested. An experimental group was trained by presenting food during a period of darkness, while control group animals were fed under regular daytime room lights many hours after the period of darkness. After the training period, the experimental group demonstrated they had learned to associate the two cues by regularly emerging during the dark period even when no food was presented. The untrained control animals, as well as pre-training experimental animals, did not emerge during the dark periods when no food was presented. This study presents strong evidence for classical conditioning in a relatively untested group of animals that lack centralized nervous systems.
