#### Abstract

There has been a recent growth in interest in the processes governing the coordination and control of locomotion in the decentralized nervous systems of echinoderms, yet our understanding of echinoderm behavior and learning remains poor. In this study we tested whether brittle stars (Class Ophiuroidea) were capable of learning to associate two cues: a short period of darkness and the presentation of a food cue. Individually housed Ophiocoma echinata were separated into experimental (trained) and control (untrained) groups. Animals in the experimental group were trained by presenting food during a short period of darkness, while control group animals were fed under regular daytime room lights many hours after the period of darkness. After the training period, the experimental group demonstrated they had learned to associate the two cues by regularly emerging during the dark period even when no food was presented. In comparison, control animals did not spontaneously emerge during the dark period (p = 0.0007). This shows that an ophiuroid species is capable of more advanced neural processing tasks than previously appreciated.
