I have been a member of the Duke Biology Department's [IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity & Anti-Racism) Committee](https://sites.duke.edu/biodiversity/) since 2016. We are a group of graduate students that work collaboratively to address issues in our department. 

You can read more about our work and initiatives on our [website](https://sites.duke.edu/biodiversity/) and catch up with us on Twitter [@DukeBioDiverse](https://twitter.com/DukeBioDiverse).
