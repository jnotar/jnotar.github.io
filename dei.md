I have been a member of the Duke Biology Department's [IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity & Anti-Racism) Committee](https://sites.duke.edu/biodiversity/graduate-student-committee/) since 2016. We are a group of graduate students that work collaboratively to address issues around diversity, equity, inclusion, and anti-racism in our department through workshops and seminars, creating written resources, and direct advocacy. In 2019, Duke's Biology PhD Program received the [Deanâ€™s Award for Inclusive Excellence in Graduate Education](https://gradschool.duke.edu/about/news/biology-phd-program-2019-dean-s-award-winner) in part due to the IDEA committee's contributions.

You can read more about our work, initiatives, and [publications](https://sites.duke.edu/biodiversity/publications/) on our [website](https://sites.duke.edu/biodiversity/) and catch up with us on Twitter [@DukeBioDiverse](https://twitter.com/DukeBioDiverse). We also run a separate website with [mental health resources](https://sites.duke.edu/biodiversity_mindhealth/) for our fellow students.
