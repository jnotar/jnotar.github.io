I have been a member of the Duke Biology Department's [IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity & Anti-Racism) Committee](https://sites.duke.edu/biodiversity/graduate-student-committee/) since 2016. We are a group of graduate students that work collaboratively to address issues around diversity, equity, inclusion, and anti-racism in our department through workshops and seminars, creating written resources, and direct advocacy.

You can read more about our work and initiatives on our [website](https://sites.duke.edu/biodiversity/) and catch up with us on Twitter [@DukeBioDiverse](https://twitter.com/DukeBioDiverse). We also run a separate website with [mental health resources](https://sites.duke.edu/biodiversity_mindhealth/) for our fellow students.
