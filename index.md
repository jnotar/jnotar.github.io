I study the visual ecology of marine invertebrates that have distributed visual systems -- what can these animals see and what decisions do they make with the information they gather from the environment? My research focuses on the echinoderms (including sea stars, sea urchins, and brittle stars) and looks at their vision and behavior in a comparative context. I am also broadly interested in sensory processing in decentralized nervous systems and the optical performance of low-resolution visual systems.
