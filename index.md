I study the visual ecology of marine invertebrates. I'm interested in animals with distributed sensory and visual systems -- what can these animals see and what decisions do they make with the information they can gather from the environment? My research the echinoderms and their vision and behavior in a comparative context. I am currently focusing on sea stars, but have worked with sea urchins and brittle stars in the past. I am also interested in other marine invertebrates, distributed processing, and low-resolution visual systems more broadly.
