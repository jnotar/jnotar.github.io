I'm a PhD Candidate in SÃ¶nke Johnsen's lab where I study the visual ecology of marine invertebrates, particularly echinoderms. I'm interested in animals with distributed sensory and visual systems -- what can these animals see and what decisions do they make with the information they can gather from the environment? My research primarily focuses on sea urchins and their visually-guided behavior in a comparative context.
